# Repair tool

Repair tool built for KA-Huis.
KA-huis is an organization running on volunteers. Many (non-profit) organizations make use of the KA-huis for their own purposes.
This tool is built as a school project. Analyses showed that the process of registering, executing and finishing chores is a time-consuming job.
Many factors in the process are resulting in a failure of completing a chore. This app prevents most of these factors which gains efficiency and time.

## Overview

The application is built using Kotlin. Design is built using Jetpack Compose.
